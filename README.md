Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
~ Software engineering is about  writing set of instructions (code) for computers,   building and designing apps, websites, game and solving-real life problems through technology.
~ Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by Ensuring Software Quality and Reliability, it Enhances Productivity and Efficiency. It Supports Scalability and Maintainability. And  it Improves Security and Data Protection e.t.c.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

~ The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) :  This milestone recognized software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing structured methods, systematic planning, and rigorous testing.

~ The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s) : The development of OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more modular and reusable.

~ The Agile Revolution (2001-Present) : This milestone transformed the way teams build software, improving adaptability to changing requirements and accelerating product delivery.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 

~ Planning: Define project goals, scope, timeline, and budget. Assess       
  feasibility, risks, and required resources.

~ Requirement Analysis: Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure clarity and 
  feasibility and gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.

~ Design: Create system architecture, database structure, and user interfaces.

~ Implementation (Coding/Development): Write, compile, and integrate code based on 
  design specifications. Follow coding standards and best practices.

~ Testing: Identify and fix bugs to ensure software quality by conducting unit 
  testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

~ Deployment: Release the software to the production environment.
  Ensure smooth installation and user accessibility.

~ Maintenance & Support: Provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements.
  Monitor performance and address user issues.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  1. Aproach
     ~ Waterfall: Sequential and linear process
     ~ Agile: Iterative and incremental process

  2. Flexibility
     ~ Waterfall: Rigid; changes are difficult to implement
     ~ Agile: Highly flexible; changes can be incorporated at any stage

  3. Project Structure
     ~ Waterfall: Defined phases (Planning → Design → Development → Testing →     
       Deployment → Maintenance)
     ~ Agile: Continuous cycles (Sprints or iterations with frequent feedback 
       loops)

  4. Requirements
     ~ Waterfall: Must be well-defined at the beginning
     ~ Agile: Evolving requirements, adaptable throughout the process

  5. Testing Phase
     ~ Waterfall: Conducted after development is complete
     ~ Agile: Continuous testing and feedback throughout the process

 6. Customer Involvement
    ~  Waterfall: Limited to the initial and final stages.
     ~ Agile: High involvement with regular feedback

 7. Time-to-Market
     ~  Waterfall: Longer, as development is completed before testing
     ~ Agile: Faster, as functional components are delivered incrementally
    

 8. Risk Management
     ~  Waterfall: Higher risk due to late-stage testing
     ~ Agile: Lower risk due to early and continuous testing

 9. Best For
     ~  Waterfall: Projects with well-defined, stable requirements
     ~ Agile: Projects with evolving requirements and need for flexibility
    
Waterfall Methodology – Best for:
~ Fixed-Requirement Projects Example: Building a bridge or a spacecraft (where changes are costly and requirements must be well-defined upfront).
~ Regulatory and Compliance-Based Projects Example: Healthcare or banking software that requires strict documentation and approvals before deployment.
~ Short-Term, Simple Projects Example: A small website development with fixed features and a well-defined scope.

Agile Methodology – Best for:
~ Software Development with Changing Requirements Example: Mobile app    development where user feedback continuously shapes new features.
~ Startups and Rapid Prototyping Example: Developing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to quickly test the market and iterate based on feedback.
~ Large, Collaborative Projects Example: E-commerce platforms like Amazon, where frequent updates and new features are required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

~ Software Developer: Is responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software applications. With responsibilities to write using programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++), test, and debug code based on project requirements.
  
~ Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software quality by identifying defects and verifying that the product meets user requirements. QA is also responsible for designing and execute test plans, including manual and automated testing.

~ Project Manager (PM): Oversees the planning, execution, and completion of software development projects. The project manager is responsible for defining project goals, scope, and timelines. Allocate resources and manage budgets. Coordinate between teams (developers, QA, designers, stakeholders) and resolve conflicts within the team. Track progress, mitigate risks, and ensure timely delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs: They enhance productivity by providing auto-completion, debugging tools, and code organization in one platform. They improve     code quality through real-time error detection and refactoring tools.
Examples of IDEs: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm.

VCS: They are important because software engineering tools enhance productivity, coding quality and collaboration by providing developers   with features such as code editors, version control debugging tools.
Examples of VCS: Git, GitHub and SVN (Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

~ Security Vulnerabilities: arise when software engineers discover security vulnerabilities or weeknesses thus  prioritize security over time-to-market pressures, and ensure the safety of end-users.

~ Bias and Fairness: issues of bias and fairness in algorithmic decision-making systems such as addressing biases in data sets, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes, and reduce the potential for discrimination.

~ Open Source Contributions: when contributing to open-source projects, such as ensuring proper attribution, respecting licensing agreements, and contributing to projects that align with ethical values and goals.

~ Adhere to ethical standards in their work:
Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks: which are IEEE Code of Ethics or the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, to guide your decision-making process when faced with ethical problems.

~ Education and Awareness: be informed about ethical issues and best practices in software engineering through continuous learning, professional development, and participation in ethical discussions and communities.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

  ~ Unit testing - testing individual components or modules of software..
  ~ Integrated testing - testing interactions between different components.
  ~ System testing - testing the entire software as a whole.
  ~ Acceptance testing - testing the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  
  Its critical aspect of quality assurance and involves various types of tests.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

~ Prompt engineering is like giving instructions ( talking to AI). You ask AI to do something by writting a prompt, a set of commands or questions.
~ AI responds on what you tell it. for AI to do exactly what you need, you must know how to talk to it. The better the prompt, the better AI responds.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
~ Vague Prompt: Write about Chinese culture.
~ Improved Prompt: Describe the significance of the Chinese New Year, including its traditions, symbolism, and how it is celebrated in different regions of China, in 250 to 350 words
~ Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective:
1. More Specific – Instead of broadly covering "Chinese culture," it focuses on Chinese New Year, a key cultural event.
2. Clear Scope – Identifies three specific aspects to discuss: traditions, symbolism, and regional variations.
3. Concise and Measurable – The word limit (300-400 words) ensures a focused and structured response.
